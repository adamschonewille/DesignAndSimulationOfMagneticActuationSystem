# Design and Simulation of a Magnetic Actuation System:
This repository serves as the updated code for the simulations I am currently performing in order to design a novel magnetic actuation system for requirement of my MASc program at the University of Toronto

All simulations are done in MATLAB.

Main simulation file is `DesignAndOptimizationOfNewSystem.m`
